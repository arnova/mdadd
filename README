Description
-----------
The mdadd script automates the process of adding (new) harddisks to multi MD-array
harddisk (e.g. in case of a disk failure). It automatically syncs bootloaders,
partition tables and the individual partitions holding the MD arrays.

There is also a script to be used for mdadm event monitoring called 
"mdadm-event-handler.sh". It automatically generates & mail status reports about
your Linux MD devices (used through mdadm.conf's PROGRAM directive).

Requirements
------------
- mdadm
- (Default) system binaries like sfdisk/fdisk/dd
- sgdisk/gdisk (when GPT support is required)
- (root) POSIX shell

Usage
-----
Use "mdadd.sh --help" for info on usage.
